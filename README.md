# 🛰️ 2024 YR4 - Asteroid Trajectory Analysis & Mission Design

## 📌 SUBJECT

- **The asteroid named _2024 YR4_ will pass close to Earth in December 2032.**
- **There is a potential risk of collision with the Moon.**

---

## 🎯 GOALS

### Phase 1: Close Approach Analysis

Timeframe: **October 1, 2032 – March 1, 2033**

1. Analyze 2024 YR4’s motion during this period.
2. Plot distance of the asteroid from:
   - The **Sun**
   - The **Moon**
   - The **Earth**
3. Plot the **Earth–YR4–Sun angle** over time.
4. Visualize the **ground-track** of the asteroid over:
   - The **Earth’s surface** (±6 hours around Time of Closest Approach - TCA)

---

### Phase 2: Interplanetary Mission Design

This phase focuses on designing a trajectory from Earth to asteroid 2024 YR4:

- Solve **Lambert’s problem** to compute interplanetary transfer orbits.
- Calculate **delta-v requirements** from **Low Earth Orbit (LEO)** to the asteroid.
- Generate **porkchop plots** to visualize feasible **departure/arrival windows**.
- Highlight **close approach dates** of the asteroid for mission planning.

## 📈 OUTPUTS & VISUALS

- **Distance Plots** of 2024 YR4 from Earth, Moon, and Sun.
- **Angle Plots**: Earth–YR4–Sun angular variation over time.
- **Ground-tracks**: 2D projections of YR4’s motion on Earth and Moon around TCA.
- **Porkchop Plots**:
  - Color-coded maps of delta-v values vs. departure and arrival dates.
  - Used to identify optimal launch windows from Earth to the asteroid.
